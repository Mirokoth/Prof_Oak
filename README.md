* Seperate modules for PGO commands and generic bot commands
* PGO Specific pokedex - https://github.com/PokemonGOAPI/PokemonDataGraber/blob/master/output.json

* Add filter to !found for 0% catch pokemon and 'fucking everywhere' pokemon
* If !find result includes < 1 secondery data, exclude "and can be obtained by"
